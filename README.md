# 📍 Plot-Sens

A small demo built with **React Native** and **Mapbox**, allowing users to interact with a map, draw points, and create geospatial areas.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- React Native  
- @rnmapbox/maps  
- TypeScript

## 🗺️ Key Features

- Interactive map visualization  
- Draw points directly on the map  
- Create areas/polygons (e.g., plots or fields)  
- Save and delete drawn areas  
- Undo last point while drawing and continue

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as a **technical demo** to explore working with maps in React Native. The goal was to practice manipulating geometries on the map and enabling basic geospatial interactions in a mobile environment.

## 🧪 Project Status

⚠️ In development.  
Currently, all logic is handled on the client side. There's no persistent data storage yet.
